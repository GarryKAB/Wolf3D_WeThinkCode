# Wolf3D_WeThinkCode
Inspired by the world-famous 90's game of similar naming (which was the first FPS ever). Explore the technique of ray-casting. The goal is to create a dynamic view inside of a maze.

You should not let Wolfenstein 3D's graphics and violent gameplay fool you! It is in fact a highly complex and advanced game.
There's a reason John Carmack is considered one of the world's best coders.

In this project, we had to follow in the footsteps of the brilliant programmer and write our own versions of Wolfenstein 3D...hold on, not re-write the entire game. We're not ready for that.
The mission was to write using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find their way.

The aim of the game was to allow the following basic options:
* Move within the maze smoothly like the real video game
* Exit the program using the `esc` key
* Rotate the camera using the arrow keys

For this graphics project, we had the liberty to use the graphics library of our chosing and I went with the SDL library.

## Planned features
I plan on expanding on this project by doing some cool things to it, here's a list of them:
* Wall textures
* Doors that open and close
* Animations
* Some bad guys to kill
* Sounds and music
* Collectable items in the maze
* Floor and Ceiling textures
* A skybox
